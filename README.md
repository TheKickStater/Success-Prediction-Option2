# Success-Prediction-Option2

This project employs a Keras LSTM (2-layer at the moment) to predict future KickStarter Project success.  The data come from WebRobots, and required a good bit of cleaning to get around memory constraints in Python and on a local machine.  The data can be found here (future hyperlink).  

The model is split from the frontend and an api call is made as opposed to running the model in-page

--pipenv needs to be built with pipenv --python 3.8.                                                    \('')/

--dash may not install properly so just install it again.                                                 \('')/
